      <p>As the start of a new semester approaches, many math departments throughout
      the United States have the task of assigning graduate students to Teaching
      Assistant (TA) positions. These decisions might be made based on a variety of
      factors such as the graduate student's mathematical background, time
      availability, or even the instructor's prefence. Usually these assignments
      might be done by hand or through a committee and so we would like to implement
      an algorithm to find a feasible assignment.</p>
      <p>Due to all of the number of graduate students, the number of courses, and
      the number of constraints imposed, this task is not easy. For this reason, we
      decided to tackle a similar problem on a smaller number of people and with
      fewer constraints. Assigning undergraduate students to research groups in the
      <a class="weblink" href="https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/">University of Kentucky Math Lab</a>
      allows us to find a simpler algorithm in this way. The number of students is
      around 20, the number of groups is around 4, and typically the most important
      constraints to keep in mind are the time availabilities of the students and
      professors leading the research groups, and the students' preferences for
      which group they want to be a part of.</p>

        <br><div style="text-align:center"><i>Graph formulation of the Math Lab assignment problem.</i></div>
      </div>

      <p>We can formulate this problem in terms of finding an optimal subgraph of a
      (bipartite) graph. Consider a set of nodes representing students and also a
      set of nodes for each lab groups available times. We draw an edge from a
      student node to a lab group time node if the student has that time available.
      We then represent preferences through weighted edges (or pictorally through
      solid or dashed edges).</p>

      <p>In this example, we have a set of 7 students and 2 groups. Each group also has
      3 available times. Note that although a group's times are distinct, different
      groups may share similar times since they are all independent of each other.
      From here, we draw the edges as specified, e.g. \( s_1 \rightarrow t_{2,1} \)
      since the Student 1 can meet at Group 2's first time. Then we can add weights
      to the edges. In the picture, we represent this through solid and dashed lines
      since adding numbers to each edge made the picture cluttered. For instance,
      the edges between Student 2 and Group 1 are solid since Student 2 preferred
      Group 1, whereas the edges from Student 2 to Group 2 are dashed since Student 2
      preferred Group 2 second.</p>

      <p>To search for this subgraph, we should also use some sort of cost function
      on the subgraphs found. One of the simplest ones would be a sum over all
      students of the index into their preference list of their assigned lab group:
      \[ \sum_{i=1}^n index(pref_i(group\_assigned_i)). \]
      As an example, if the preference list of a student was (Group 2, Group 1,
      Group 2) and the student was assigned to Group 2, then the cost associated
      would be \( 2 \). Using this as a cost function, our goal is to minimize
      this sum since this would correspond to students being assigned to groups
      which they preferred least. We can now implement an algorithm for finding
      this subgraph.</p>
