                <p>As the start of a new semester approaches, many many math departments throughout
                the United States have the task of assigning graduate students to Teaching
                Assistant (TA) positions. These decisions might be made based on a variety of
                factors such as the graduate student's mathematical background, time
                availability, or even the intstuctor's prefence. Usually these assignments
                might be done by hand or through a committee and so we would like to implement
                an algorithm to find a feasible assignment.</p>
                <p>Due to all of the number of graduate students, the number of courses, and
                the number of constraints imposed, this task is not easy. For this reason, we
                decided to tackle a similar problem on a smaller number of people and with
                fewer constraints. Assigning undergraduate students to research groups in the
                <a class="weblink" href="https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/">University of Kentucky Math Lab</a>
                allows us to find a simpler algorithm in this way. The number of students is
                around 20, the number of groups is around 4, and typically the most important
                constraints to keep in mind are the time availavbilities of the students and
                professors leading the research groups, and the students' preferences for
                which group they want to be a part of.</p>
